Danfe is a now **turing complete** programming language that I am hacking up in my spare time. It's active on developement and mostly useable except the performance issues.


## Concept

It is a **Dynamic Assembler Engine** which is just fancy term to say it modular language compiler. Danfe is written in such a way that it is going to be easier to hackup a compiler for other languages in short period of time. Danfe can compile into a human readable code of other languages (for eg: **asm**, **golang**, **js**, **vlang**, **c**, **python**).
